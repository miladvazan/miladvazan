### Hi there üëã
- üî≠ Deep Learning Researcher
- üìù Author
- üéì Msc Computer Science (Tabriz University)
- üéì PhD student in Computer Science

My name is Milad Vazan, and I am a passionate computer engineer and researcher specializing in deep learning and artificial intelligence. I hold a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Payame Noor University and a master's degree in computer science with a focus on soft computing and artificial intelligence from University of Tabriz.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science and a deep understanding of cutting-edge technologies. My passion for deep learning has driven me to contribute significantly to the field. I am the proud author of three books on deep learning and one book on machine learning, all written in the Persian language. These books aim to make complex concepts more accessible to Persian-speaking audiences and empower them to effectively utilize these technologies.

As a researcher, I am particularly interested in the field of deep learning. I constantly strive to explore new methodologies and techniques that can enhance the capabilities and applications of deep learning models. My research efforts have been focused on advancing the field and addressing real-world challenges through the democratization of deep learning.

I love learning new skills and furthering my own knowledge because it allows me to grow and evolve as an individual. The process of acquiring new skills opens up endless possibilities and enriches my life in numerous ways. When I embark on a journey to learn a new skill, whether it's acquiring a foreign language, developing proficiency in a specific academic subject, or honing my critical thinking abilities, I embrace the challenge with enthusiasm and dedication. Each new skill I acquire expands my horizons, broadens my perspective, and enhances my understanding of the world around me. Learning new skills is an empowering experience that boosts my self-confidence. As I overcome obstacles and make progress, I gain a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. It reminds me of my potential for growth and shows me that with perseverance and determination, I can achieve anything I set my mind to. Moreover, learning new skills enhances my adaptability and resilience. In a rapidly changing world, being open to acquiring new knowledge and abilities enables me to stay relevant and navigate through various challenges. It equips me with the tools necessary to thrive in different academic environments and seize opportunities that come my way. Additionally, the process of learning new skills fosters a sense of curiosity and continuous improvement within me. It encourages me to explore diverse subjects, engage in lifelong learning, and seek out new challenges. I find joy in acquiring knowledge and find satisfaction in the pursuit of personal growth. Furthermore, learning new skills opens doors to new social connections and collaborations within academic circles. It provides opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals who share similar interests and passions in the academic realm. Engaging in communities of learners allows me to exchange ideas, gain different perspectives, and engage in meaningful discussions, thereby enriching my overall learning experience. Ultimately, the pursuit of learning new skills is a lifelong journey that brings me fulfillment, personal
