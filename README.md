### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 Deep Learning Researcher
- 📝 Author
- 🎓 Msc Computer Science (Tabriz University)
- 🎓 PhD student in Computer Science

My name is Milad Vazan, and I am a passionate computer engineer and researcher specializing in deep learning and artificial intelligence. I hold a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Payame Noor University and a master's degree in computer science with a focus on soft computing and artificial intelligence from University of Tabriz .

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science and a deep understanding of cutting-edge technologies. My passion for deep learning has driven me to contribute significantly to the field. I am the proud author of three books on deep learning and one book on machine learning, all written in the Persian language. These books aim to make complex concepts more accessible to Persian-speaking audiences and empower them to effectively utilize these technologies.

As a researcher, I am particularly interested in the field of deep learning. I constantly strive to explore new methodologies and techniques that can enhance the capabilities and applications of deep learning models. My research efforts have been focused on advancing the field and addressing real-world challenges through the democratization of deep learning.
